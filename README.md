# kimi-icon-theme (dark & light versions)

Largely based on Papirus, with elements of La Capitaine and Suru ++

To install simply unpack file into your icon folder in /usr/share/icons (system wide) or /.config/share/icons (current user) on arch based distros, location may vary on other distros.
Tested on Majanro Gnome
Enjoy!
